IMPORTANT!
~~~~~~~~~~

This program is freeware and can freely be spread, as long as this readme is included and no changes to both the program and the readme were made!
I take no responsibility of any damage caused by usage of this product!

Installation and deinstallation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No installation necessary.
Just extract the files into one directory und delete them after use.
You will also need to put the D3DX81ab.dll file into the \Windows\System32\ directory.


Brief instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most parts of the program are self-explanatory, but here are some hints:

- you can switch navigation with the keys 1 to 4, if the navigation menu is hidden
- the marking "[-]" after an object name means that the object is empty (no spheres, boxes, vertices or faces); that's the case when the object is a LOD or if it's inaccessible in the game
- to change the color and/or the description of a surface use the button "Apply Changes"
- a question mark instead of the surface name means that this surface type is unknown yet (red color)
- car parameters are needed to define the part of a car that gets damaged, you can change them in the "Change Surface..." menu

Known problems/bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't be surprised at the stupid stuff in peds.col, this file is useless for the game.

The program doesn't work on a few Windows XP sytems, but on mine it works perfectly.
On Win98 there are some problems (error messages), I wasn't able to fix them yet.
